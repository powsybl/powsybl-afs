# README

These are the documentation sources for PowSyBl-AFS features.

Please keep them up to date with your developments.  
They are published on [powsybl-afs.readthedocs.io](http://powsybl-afs.readthedocs.io/) and pull requests are built and previewed automatically.

To build the docs locally, run the following commands:
~~~bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
sphinx-build -a docs ./build-docs
~~~
Then open `build-docs/index.html` in your browser.
